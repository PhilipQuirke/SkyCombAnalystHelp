# [SkyComb Analyst](https://github.com/PhilipQuirke/SkyCombAnalystHelp/blob/main/README.md) - Size Categories

## Overview
The size of animals detected by SkyComb are measured in square-centimeters (cm2) as measured from above looking straight down.


## Size Categories
The size data is categorised into 8 size categories to make it easier to understand.
The size categories are named using the "t-shirt sizes" scale: XXS, XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL.
Each size category has an associated from / to range in cm2 as shown here:

Each size category contains more than one animal species. 
So a size category is not enough by itself to derive the species of a given animal. 

The strip of animal images under the table is **indicative** only. 
It helps the user remember what each size category means.

## Size Histogram
After a video has been processed, and animals have been detected, 
a histogram of the number of animals per size category is shown.

## SkyComb Analyst Size Filter
After a video has been processed, and animals have been detected, 
filters on the main page of SkyComb Analyst allow the user to select a range of sizes to focus on.
