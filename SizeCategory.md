# [SkyComb Analyst](https://github.com/PhilipQuirke/SkyCombAnalystHelp/blob/main/README.md) - Size Categories

## Overview
The size of animals detected by SkyComb are measured in square-centimeters (cm2) as measured from above looking straight down.
This size data is categorised into 8 size classes to make it easier to understand.

## Size Categories
SkyComb size categories are based on the "t-shirt sizes": XXS, XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL.
Each size category has an associated from / to range in cm2. The range for each category is shown here:

![Animal Sizes](./Static/AnimalSizes.png?raw=true "Animal Sizes")

Each size category contains more than one animal species. 
So a size category is not enough to derive the animal species. 

The strip of animal images under the table is indicative only. 
It helps the user remember what each size category means.

## Size Histogram
After a video has been processed, and animals have been detected, 
a histogram of the number of animals per size category is shown.

## SkyComb Analyst Size Filter
After a video has been processed, and animals have been detected, 
filters on the main page of SkyComb Analyst allow the user to select a range of sizes to focus on.
