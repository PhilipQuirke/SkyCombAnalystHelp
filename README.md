# [SkyComb Analyst](https://github.com/PhilipQuirke/SkyCombAnalystHelp/) 

# Background
SkyComb Analyst is a tool aimed at environmentalists, scientists & software developers. 
It allows drones equipped with thermal and optical video cameras, to fly over forests, 
to detect animals, in a repeatable fashion, giving a robust statistical estimate of the animal population. 
It converts thermal drones from toys into scientific data-collection platforms. 


# What does it do?
SkyComb Analyst decodes the "flight log" data capturing by the drone during the flight. 
It displays flight path, speed, altitude, yaw, etc data:  

![Path, Speed & Altitude](./Static/Overview1.png?raw=true "Path, Speed & Altitude")

It decodes the drone flight area, and loads highly-detailed (1m grid) and 
highly-accurate publically-available ground-elevation data (+/- 0.2m) and 
tree-top height data for the area the drone flew over:

![DEM & DSM Elevations](./Static/Overview2.png?raw=true "DEM & DSM Elevations")

It combines the drone, ground and tree-top altitude data. If you follow our recommended flight protocols, 
SkyComb Analyst can automatically correct for (very common) drone altitude inaccuracies:

![Drone Altitude Correction](./Static/OnGroundAtExamples.png?raw=true "Drone Altitude Correction")

It automatically finds the parts of the drone flight that have a (mostly) constant altitude, in a (mostly) constant direction 
for a reasonable length of time. These it calls "legs". For each leg, it processes the drone thermal video, 
detecting animals, and displaying the results:

![Thermal & Optical Videos](./Static/Overview3.png?raw=true "Thermal & Optical Videos")

The overall user interface of this Windows based tool looks like this:

![User Interface](./Static/UIExample.png?raw=true "User Interface")

After the video(s) are processed:
- The derived data and associated visualisations are immediately saved on disk as a video and/or as a spreadsheet (for further analysis and re-use).
- The "Object explorer" window can be used to view the objects detected during processing:

![Object Explorer](./Static/ObjectExplorer.png?raw=true "Object Explorer")

These pages explain the input, use and outputs of the application in more detail:
- The [End to End Usage](./Usage.md) page has more detail on flying drone data collection missions to collect high-quality data.  
- The [ApplicationInterface](./ApplicationInterface.md) page has more detail on using the application interface.  
- The [DataStore](./DataStore.md) page has more detail on the spreadsheet generated by the application.

# Image Processing Models
The user can select one of several image processing models via the RunProcess dropdown. 
This can help users understand/experiment with these processes.

The available models are None, Smooth, Threshold, Flow, Comb (recommended), Contour, Distance and Gftt.
The models output markedly different images. 

![Process Examples](./Static/ModelExamples.png?raw=true "Process Examples")

The [Process](./Model.md) page has more detail on the processes. 
It also has recommended config settings for specific drone types.
