# Introduction
SkyComb Analyst processes data collected by drones equipped with thermal and optical video cameras. It detects animals & shows their size, temperature & height above ground. It generates (thermal & optical) close up videos of the animals.

As flying platforms, data generated by drones has many inaccuracies. If you follow the SkyComb Analyst recommendations on how to fly your drone, SkyComb Analyst can automatically compensate for several inaccuracies.

Where it is available, SkyComb Analyst supplements the drone data with very accurate ground and tree top elevation data from public sources, increasing the height data accuracy.

SkyComb Analyst can generate animal population statistics for the area flown over, in a robust and repeatable fashion. It generates [spreadsheets](./DataStore.md) and annotated video as output. This output can used later for further analysis e.g. as input to image recognition software.

SkyComb Analyst provides an easy to use [interface](./UserInterface.md) that converts your drone into a scientific data-collection platform.

# Tooling 
Developed using:
- Emgu, a C# wrapper around the OpenCV image processing library. Refer nuget package in project
- EPPlus, a spreadsheet tool. Refer nuget package in project
- Visual Studio Community 2022 downloaded from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/

# Caveats
This application has only been extensively tested with:
- Data from a DJI Mavic 2 Enterprise (M2E) Dual drone. SkyComb Analyst is designed to support any drone, but other drone models may require some code changes around flight log parsing and loading. Refer [Drone](./Drone.md) for more details.
- Data generated using the [End to End Usage](./Usage.md) page data collection recommendations, especially: 1) the flight start and end on the ground and 2) the camera(s) should be pointing straight down during the flight. SkyComb Analyst will support other flight configurations, but the height accuracy will be worse.  
- Ground (surface and treetop) data from New Zealand. SkyComb Analyst is designed to support any country, but supporting additional countries will involve locating publically available ground data, and parsing and loading that data. Refer [Ground](./Ground.md) for more detail.
