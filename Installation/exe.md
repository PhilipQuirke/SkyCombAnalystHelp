# [SkyComb Analyst](https://github.com/PhilipQuirke/SkyCombAnalystHelp/blob/main/README.md) Executable Installation

## Overview
SkyComb Analyst can be installed using an executable installer file. This page details how to download and run the installer.

## Downloading the Installer
The latest SkyComb Analyst installer executable is currently provided by SkyComb staff on demand.

## Running the Installer
To install SkyComb Analyst using the installer executable:
1. Locate the downloaded installer file `SkyCombAnalystInstaller`.
2. Double-click the installer file to run it.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the installation process. You may need to agree to license terms and choose an installation directory.
4. Once the installation is complete, you can launch SkyComb Analyst from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut.

## Patching the Installation (deprecated)
Previous versions of the installer had a fault - they did not install the text file libv_list.ini which the DJI SDK needs. 
To fix this issue, download the file [SkyCombAnalystHelp//libv_list.ini](https://github.com/PhilipQuirke/SkyCombAnalystHelp/blob/main/static/libv_list.ini) and copy it to the installation folder, typically `C:\Program Files\SkyComb\SkyComb Analyst\`.

This completes the installation of SkyComb Analyst.
